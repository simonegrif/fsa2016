 element of the list. The second one only folds once, so it is more efficient

foldl does not work on infinite lists, 
since it starts with applying the function on the last element of the list-}

{-Crime Scene Investigation

A group of five school children is caught in a crime. 
One of them has stolen something from some kid they all dislike. 
The headmistress has to find out who did it. 
She questions the children, and this is what they say:

Matthew: Carl didnâ€™t do it, and neither did I.

Peter: It was Matthew or it was Jack.

Jack: Matthew and Peter are both lying.

Arnold: Matthew or Peter is speaking the truth, but not both.

Carl: What Arnold says is not true.

Their class teacher now comes in. 
She says: three of these boys always tell the truth, 
and two always lie. -}

accusers :: Boy -> [Boy]
guilty, honest :: [Boy]

{-All statements the boys make, can actually be converted into
statements about people they accuse of being a possible thief. 
(e.g. "I did not do it" is the same as: all others might be the thief)
This translate into the following accuses function-}

accuses Matthew x = x /= Carl && x /= Matthew
accuses Peter x = x == Matthew || x == Jack
accuses Jack x = not (accuses Matthew x) && not (accuses Peter x)
accuses Arnold x = ((accuses Matthew x) || (accuses Peter x)) && not ((accuses Matthew x) && (accuses Peter x))
accuses Carl x = not (accuses Arnold x)

-- now we can make a list of accusers of each boy
accusers x = [y | y <- boys, accuses y x]

{-- since only three boys tell the truth, 
the thief must have exactly those 3 boys as accusers.
This gives us the lists with the guilty one and the honest boys 
(honest boys are the ones accusing the guilty one)-}
